# Coffee Sales Analysis 

This project analyzes a coffee sales dataset using both SQL and NoSQL workflows. It covers data cleaning, schema design, and exploratory analysis across relational tables and document-based structures. The analysis focuses on identifying top-performing beverages, best-selling categories, high-revenue stores, and seller performance trends. More exploration is covered in the README.md with in-depth queries for both SQL and NoSQL.
